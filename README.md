# Async-experiments
Playing with async / await

Note that the starting point for this repo was Rick Anderson's excellent sample code: https://github.com/RickAndMSFT/Async-ASP.NET.git

# Original readme from Rick Anderson:

Async-ASP.NET
=============

ASP.NET MVC 4/RC, Web Forms and Web API Asynchronous samples.
You must first build the WebAPI application. The Web API app serves data for both the MVC and the Web Forms projects.
See WebAPI\WebAPIpgw\Notes.html

For the MVC Application, see Mvc4Async\Mvc4Async\mvc4async_setup.html

For Web Forms, instructions are a work in progress.

# Exercises and Examples

CSudbery, May 2017:

I have added several exercises and examples. The exercises can be found in ExercisesController.cs and the examples can be found in ExamplesController.cs.

They are all commented with explanations and instructions. 

As long as you have the web api running (WebAPI\WebAPIpgw), you can build and run Mvc4Async, and you will see links in your browser for exercises and examples.

See Async-summary.docx for more detailed notes.
